Multi-class sentiment analysis problem to classify texts into five emotion categories: joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral. A fun weekend project to go through different text classification techniques. This includes dataset preparation, traditional machine learning with scikit-learn, LSTM neural networks and transfer learning using BERT (tensorflow keras).
